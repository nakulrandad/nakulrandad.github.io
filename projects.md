### [AUV-IITB](http://auv-iitb.org/) | Underwater Robotics

AUV-IITB is a multidisciplinary team of 50+ members at IIT Bombay focused on developing autonomous underwater vehicles from the perspective to handle real-time tasks. The vehicles are capable of way-point navigation, object detection, robotic actuation, acoustic communication etc. underwater.


### [QuITO](https://github.com/tcatapano) | Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization

QuITO

### [Mini Games](https://github.com/nakulrandad/Games)

A 2D game developed as a hobby project wich includes designing the enemy & player battleships, background effects, music additions and creating powerups.


### [Solar Radiation Prediction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cYWwQR02r17Bgc7hXHiDjqEfJLtR3x6AE6GK5HvttNw/edit?usp=sharing) | Machine Learning

Implemented model which predicts irradiation falling on the ground for different prediction horizons using SVM (Support Vector Machine) and compares with the Neural Networks. The multilayer perceptron architecture in NN has three layers with ReLU activation.
